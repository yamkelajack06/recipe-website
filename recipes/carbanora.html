    <h2>How to make Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
    <p>
        To make spaghetti carbonara, cook spaghetti noodles in a large pot of salted water according to package instructions. 
        While the pasta cooks, heat a pan over medium heat and cook diced pancetta or bacon until crispy. In a separate bowl, 
        whisk together eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. Once the pasta is cooked, reserve some of the pasta water 
        and then drain the noodles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add the hot pasta to the pan with the crispy pancetta, then quickly mix in the egg and cheese mixture, adding pasta water 
        a little at a time to achieve a creamy texture. Serve immediately with extra Parmesan and black pepper on top. Enjoy your 
        creamy and delicious spaghetti carbonara!
