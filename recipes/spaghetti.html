    <h2>How to make Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>
        To make spaghetti, start by boiling a large pot of salted water. Once it’s boiling, add the spaghetti noodles 
        and cook according to the package instructions, usually 8-10 minutes. While the pasta cooks, prepare the sauce. 
        Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat, then sauté garlic until fragrant. Add tomato sauce, salt, pepper, and 
        any herbs you like (basil or oregano work well). Let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the pasta is done, drain it and add it to the pan with the sauce. Toss to coat the pasta evenly, then serve with
        freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top. Enjoy your delicious homemade spaghetti!
