    <h2>How to make Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
        Making homemade lasagna starts with preparing a rich meat sauce.
        Brown ground beef or Italian sausage in a pan with diced onions and garlic, then drain any excess fat. 
        Add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste, seasoning with salt, pepper, oregano, and basil.
        Let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes to develop deep flavors.
        Meanwhile, mix ricotta cheese with an egg, grated Parmesan, and chopped parsley to create a creamy filling. 
        Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions, then drain and lay them flat to prevent sticking.
    </p>
    <p>
        To assemble, spread a thin layer of meat sauce in a baking dish, 
        followed by a layer of noodles, then the ricotta mixture, 
        and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese.
        Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a final topping of sauce and mozzarella.
        Cover with foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for about 30 minutes, 
        then uncover and bake for another 10-15 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly. 
        Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing to help the layers set, then serve and enjoy!
